## What to Do Next

After running the command and receiving the output:

1. Open your preferred AI tool, such as ChatGPT or Claude.
2. Paste the copied prompt into the input field of the AI tool.
3. Review the AI's response, which will provide you with further insights, examples, and clarifications on the topics you've chosen.

## How It Works

Upon running the CLI, you will be prompted to enter a main topic ([X]) and a sub-topic ([Y]). The tool generates a structured output tailored to your inputs.
